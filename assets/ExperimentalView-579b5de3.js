I experimented with producing prints using 2 or more negatives. Utilizing both existing negatives and capturing new photos of intriguing subjects, I created prints on photo paper. The method involved developing an initial print from one negative and subsequently layering it with a print from a second negative before undergoing the development process.<br><br>I recently established my own darkroom (finally). As depicted in the photo, I collaborate with someone who is not familiar with photography. She is pursuing a degree in art therapy, focusing particularly on visual arts, especially painting. Our collaboration yields fascinating results, offering different perspectives and opinions. My contribution revolves around the photographic image, while hers centers on the realm of painting. Itâ€™s a delightful and enriching experience. Additionally, having a companion in that dimly lit room adds to the enjoyment. </p></div><div class="basis-1/2"><img class="h-auto" src="'+s+'"></div></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900"><img class="scale-90 translate-x-16 translate-y-40" src="'+i+'"><img class="scale-50 -translate-y-20" src="'+n+'"><img class="scale-50" src="'+r+'"><img class="scale-75 -translate-y-72" src="'+o+'"><img class="" src=""><img class="scale-90 -translate-y-80 -translate-x-32" src="'+l+'"></div>',2),p=[c],f={__name:"ExperimentalView",setup(g){return(d,h)=>(e(),t("main",null,p))}};export{f as default};
